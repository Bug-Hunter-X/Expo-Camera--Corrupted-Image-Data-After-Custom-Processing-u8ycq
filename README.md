# Expo Camera: Corrupted Image Data After Custom Processing

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo Camera API where custom image processing can result in corrupted image data. The issue is more likely to occur when processing large images or performing complex manipulations.

## Bug Description

When using the Expo Camera API's `takePictureAsync` method and subsequently processing the image data (e.g., using a library like `react-native-image-manipulator`), the processed image might contain corrupted data or unexpected pixel values. This can lead to crashes or visual artifacts in the application.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app on an iOS or Android device/simulator.
4. Take a picture using the app. The processed image might show corruption or the app might crash.

## Solution

The solution involves adding robust error handling and possibly adjusting the image processing techniques to mitigate the issue.  The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to implement appropriate error handling and data validation to prevent crashes and gracefully handle potential corruption.
